Before using the `gcloud` command line tool to deploy your app to Google Cloud Platform, you'll need to authenticate it in order to give it the correct permissions. In order to do this, you'll need to create a [JSON Service Account](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2ServiceAccount). This Service Account can then be encoded in base64 and added as a CircleCI environment variable. Your build script can then decode the JSON file and it use to authenticate the gcloud tool, which can then be used to deploy and interact with your project.

## Creating and downloading the JSON Service Account

To download a Service Account, click this [link](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials/serviceaccountkey?project=_), or just go to go to https://console.developers.google.com/, and then on the left-hand menu click 'API Manager', then 'Credentials', then 'New credentials', then select 'Service account key'. Create a new service account, give it a name, make sure it's in the JSON format, then click 'Create'. This will download the Service Account JSON file.

Please keep in mind that the Service Account is a credential that can be used to interact with the project on your behalf, so keep it secret along with any other credentials.

## Adding the Service Account to the CircleCI environment

Once the Service Account is created, the next step is to add it as an environment variable to your CircleCI environment. First, you'll need to encode it in base64 format. To do so, on Linux or OS X, type

    base64 <your-service-account.json>

and then copy the result of that command. Windows users will need to use [certutil](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16945780/decoding-base64-in-batch).

Once you have copied the value of your JSON Service Account, go to your CircleCI project, click 'Project Settings' in the top right, then click 'Environment variables' on the left hand side. Add a new Name called `CLIENT_SECRET`, and paste the value of your encoded Service Account into the Value form, then click 'Save variables'. Your Service Account can now be accessed from within your CircleCI build job.

## Using the Service Account to Authenticate the gcloud tool

Once your encoded Service Account is added as an environment variable, the next step is to decode it in your build script and use it to authenticate the gcloud tool. Here is an example of how to do that:

    echo $CLIENT_SECRET | base64 --decode > ${HOME}/client-secret.json

This decodes the secret into a file named client-secret.json. Next, authenticate the gcloud command with that account. Updating the gcloud tool first is a good best-practice, and don't forget to set your project.

	gcloud --quiet components update
	gcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file ${HOME}/client-secret.json
	gcloud config set project $GCLOUD_PROJECT

## Security Considerations

If you add the Service Account to your CircleCI environment, that environment now contains credentials which if compromised could compromise your project. One danger is that someone submits a PR to your project that changes the CircleCI build to print your credentials or otherwise use the gcloud tool to do malicious actions. Fortunately, by default CircleCI does not provide UI configured environment variables to Pull Requests. You can read more about this topic [here]({{site.baseurl}}/fork-pr-builds/).
